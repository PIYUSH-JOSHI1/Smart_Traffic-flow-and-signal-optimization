# Smart_Traffic-flow-and-signal-optimization
 Our predictive model utilizes vehicle-actuated signals and queue length data from cameras  to optimize signal timings. By accurately counting vehicles in queues, we dynamically adjust signal times, enhancing traffic flow efficiency and decreasing congestion on traffic signal
